# ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Run Database Migration

The app is now running, but you need to run the database migration to set up the tables.

## Steps to Run Migration:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://app.supabase.com
   - Select your project (mvsbbtdaekskmdrvhbgq)

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query" button

3. **Copy Migration SQL**
   - Open the file: `supabase/migrations/20240728000000_initial_schema.sql`
   - Copy ALL contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)

4. **Run Migration**
   - Paste the SQL into the query editor
   - Click the "RUN" button
   - You should see "Success. No rows returned"

5. **Verify Tables Created**
   - Go to "Table Editor" in the sidebar
   - You should see these new tables:
     - profiles
     - teams
     - team_members
     - learning_modules
     - user_progress
     - ai_interactions
     - analytics_events

## âœ… Once Done:

The app is already running at http://localhost:3000

You can now:
- Sign up for an account
- Explore the dashboard
- Test the features

## ðŸ›  If You Get Errors:

If you see "type already exists" errors, the migration may have partially run. You can:
1. Drop all tables and types first
2. Re-run the migration
