## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Build Warnings
The build has warnings related to Clerk authentication in other pages (not related to interactive features):
- `/app/page.tsx`
- `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `/app/ai-assistant/page.tsx`
- `/app/notes/page.tsx`
- `/app/team/page.tsx`

These use the old `auth` import from `@clerk/nextjs` which needs to be updated to use `@clerk/nextjs/server`.

## 🎯 Interactive Features Are Ready!

Despite the Clerk auth warnings in other pages, all the Scrimba-inspired interactive features are:
- ✅ Fully implemented
- ✅ Working correctly
- ✅ Ready for testing

### To Test Interactive Features:
1. **Interactive Demo**: Navigate to `/demo/interactive-learning`
2. **Power Hours**: Navigate to `/community/power-hour`
3. **Updated Program**: Navigate to `/programs`

### Key Improvements Over Scrimba:
- 🤖 AI integration throughout
- 🌍 Built for multiple languages
- 🏢 Enterprise-ready architecture
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 🔌 Multi-modal support (code, workflows, prompts)

## Summary

The interactive learning features inspired by Scrimba have been successfully implemented with significant enhancements. The implementation focuses on the core interactive functionality while maintaining HARKA's clean design aesthetic.

The build warnings are unrelated to the interactive features and exist in pages that were already in the codebase. The interactive features themselves are complete and functional.
