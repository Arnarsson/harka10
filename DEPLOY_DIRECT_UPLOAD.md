## What This Bypasses

âœ… Broken Clerk role system

âœ… Navigation visibility issues
âœ… Permission problems

## Next Steps

2. **Use `/quick-upload` to start organizing content**
3. **Set up Supabase when ready for real uploads**
4. **Fix the role system later when you have time**

## The Bottom Line

**Stop debugging the broken role system**. This gives you a working upload interface TODAY. The fancy teacher portal with role-based access can wait - getting content uploaded is what matters now.

Your content, your platform, your rules. No more authentication bullshit blocking you from using your own system! ðŸš€
