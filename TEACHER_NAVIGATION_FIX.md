# Teacher Navigation Access Fix

## Problem Identified
The comprehensive teacher upload system was built and working, but users couldn't access it because:
1. No navigation links to teacher upload functionality
2. Users had to manually type URLs like `/teach/upload`
3. Teacher features weren't visible in the UI

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Navigation Configuration (`lib/navigation-config.ts`)
Added missing teacher navigation items:
- **Teacher Dashboard** (`/teach/dashboard`) - Overview of teaching activities
- **Upload Content** (`/teach/upload`) - Upload videos, documents, interactive content
- **Interactive Builder** (`/teach/interactive`) - Create hands-on interactive lessons

### 2. Updated Smart Navigation (`components/navigation/smart-navigation.tsx`)
- Teacher dropdown now appears for both `teacher` and `admin` roles
- Shows "Teach" button with BETA badge
- Contains all teacher tools in dropdown menu

### 3. Updated Mobile Navigation (`components/navigation/mobile-nav.tsx`)
- Teacher features section for mobile users
- Accessible to both teacher and admin roles
- Properly categorized as "Teacher Tools"

## How Users Access Teacher Features

### For Desktop Users:
1. Sign in with teacher or admin role
2. Look for "Teach" button in top navigation (purple outline with BETA badge)
3. Click dropdown to see:
   - Teacher Dashboard

   - Interactive Builder

### For Mobile Users:
1. Sign in with teacher or admin role
